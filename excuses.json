The incident involved two vehicles, resulting in traffic congestion and significant delays for several hours.\n\nThe accident was caused by a driver who lost control due to wet road conditions, causing one vehicle to collide with another. No serious injuries were reported, but the vehicles required tow trucks to remove them from the scene.\n\nTraffic was diverted to the shoulder lanes, and the affected area was closed for approximately 2 hours while emergency services responded and cleared the scene. Traffic returned to normal by 10:45 AM.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, and we appreciate your patience during this incident.
